            If you follow the tide of this industry, you might assuming that doing open source is a no-brainer.
            Well, I'm here to tell you it's not; not a no-brainer that is.
            Sorry, you can't just phone this one in.

            Doing open source, doing it well, and growing a successful ecosystem around it requires quite a lot of brain power.
            It's hard and doesn't come for free.
            Responding to questions.
            Reviewing issues & code changes.
            Motivating people.
            It's a daily duty.
            It takes investment, both in the form of time and money.
            But that investment will pay you back in spades for sure.
          p.
            Open source is the best model we've found for producing software.
            Do it poorly and what you unleash onto the world amounts to little more than a code dump.
            But do it well and your project will grow and develop a life of its own.
          p.
            So how do you do it?
            How do you give your project that spark?
            How do you make it grow?

            Each experience has taught me lessons I'm sharing with you today.

            I, like many other people, connected with Bernie's message, his passion, his authenticity.
            His words awoke something inside of me and millions of others.
            He confronted the challenges and foreshadowed what could be, then told us we could have those things only if we got involved.
            He spoke of a participatory democracy.
            He made people feel.
            When he comes on stage, there's so much passion he disrupts the flow.

            Open source, too, is created by people.
            Thus, to grow open source, you need to understand what motivates them.
            You need to AMP them up.
            In his book Drive, Dan Pink identifies three key factors that drive people.

          p.
            As with campaigns and social movements, participation in open source is voluntary.
            Remember and respect that.
            But also recognize people aren't working for free.
            Thinking that would be naive.
            They simply aren't working for direct financial gain, the traditional model.
            They're driven by something else.
            People participate to do what they enjoy far away from what they don't.
            They participate to change something.
            They participate to learn from each other and grow.
            They value the exchange of ideas.
            They work for personal fulfillment...at least your audience does.
          p.
            You need to craft a call to adventure for the hero, your community.
            Your mission becomes a story; your story.
            It shapes the culture of your community.
            It serves as a filter to help you decide what to do, what not to do and who your audience is.

            Off-centered ales for off-centered people.
          p.
            Notice how the tagline communicates a purpose (what they want to achieve), a filter (what to do, what not do), and an identity (who they are).
            That's the stuff that gets people behind you, gets them involved and gives you focus.
            Don't let people just pass you by.

            Every project starts out a ghost town.
            And no activity signals a dead project.
            People kick things—show aggression towards things—they think are dead.
            And that's damaging for growth.

            Be everywhere.
            Communicate openly to a fault.
            Take the time to meet with them; get to know the individuals.
            Make them feel like you have all the time in the world for them...even if you don't.
            Do it by making each person the center of your attention when you're interacting with them.

            Communication is 2-way, so LISTEN TO THEM too!
            They hold the secret (and the numbers) to what can make you great.
            That's because the intelligence of a project is in the collective thinking.
            Power in numbers.
            To realize that power, communication must be easy; even better if it is contextual (e.g., GitHub issues).

            Communication doesn't necessarily mean a lot of words.
            Communication can be terse and still be very effective.
            That's power of the +1.
            It not only says, “I'm present and I support this,” it also provides encouragement, which we'll talk about a bit later.

            If you're working for a company that sponsers an OSS project, don't let yourself get lost on the inside.

            that it matters to have them around.
            There are no secrets here.
            When you appreciate their presence and their work, contributors will choose to stay and repeat the virtuous cycle.
          pre.
            I see you.
            I recognize your effort.
            I value your contribution.
            You have ownership.
          p.
            Recognizing people also helps them stay motivated; to meet their purpose; affirms their goals.
            It's positive reinforcement.
            It let's them know they're improving.
            You recognize that the contributor has a place in the community and recognizes his/her role.
            And it's <strong>easy</strong>, so there's just no reason to not do it.

            I want to now share with you a personal example.
          p.
            I've been working with OSS communities for a long time.
            But I could never quite put my finger on why one community works and another doesn't.
            What makes it tick?
            ...until in Antwerp during Devoxx 2013.
          p.
            Two years earlier, Aslak Knutsen (Arquillian project lead) and I were walking with a newcomer to the Arquillian community, Bartosz Majsak.
            We arrived at a restaurant where we were going to eat dinner and we asked him to join us.
            He said, “No. I have to go. I'm not a speaker like you guys so I probably can't join you.” and walked off.
            Aslak and I looked at each other with a bewildered look, instinctually agreed that wasn't going to fly and Aslak chased after him and pulled him back.
            Bartosz was just as much a part of Arquillian as either of us.
          p.
            Fast-forward two years and Bartosz had become a speaker at Devoxx.
            A Devoxxian.
            He was speaking about getting involved in open source.
          p.
            That year, we were all rooming together, but left the apartment at different times the morning of his talk.
            (Why Bartosz wasn't with us when we left the apartment is a story to share over drinks about drinks).
            I had attended another talk before Bartosz's and got held up afterwards chatting with someone in the corridor, so I ended up being a few minutes late getting over to Bartosz's talk.

          p.
            As I entered the room, the room monitor looked at me shaking her head at my chances for a seat.
            I literally had to step over people standing in the entranceway to get just close enough to catch a glimpse of Bartosz on stage.
            The theatre was completely packed.
          p. 
            Two years earlier, Bartosz had viewed himself as just another person in the crowd, not worthy of note.
            Now, despite the fact that I was part of the Arquillian leadership, I couldn't even get into the room to see him speak.
            Amazing.
            We believed in him before he was ready to believe in himself--we never even questioned it--and now he had become a luminary.
          p. 
            But that's not even the most amazing part.
            The focus of his talk was to encourage others to get involved with open source and how it changes your life and career, as it had done for him.

          p.
            About half way through the talk, he put up names and faces of other open source contributors on the screen and he said, "these are the people that inspire me".
            But those people weren't the project leaders, they were other community members.
          p.
            He went even a step further.
            Despite only having a “quicky” time slot, which run 15 minutes, he turned over the stage to another developer who he had met at the Hackergaten earlier in the week to talk share his work.
            Rather than use the stage to talk about himself, Bartosz had chosen to shine light on the work of others.
          p.
            At that moment I realized this is what makes community work.
            This is what makes it grow.
            Direct limelight on people that should be recognized, but aren't yet.
            Make opportunities for others.
            Bartosz had responded to the call to grow the community and become a reflector of that light.

          p.
            Back in 2012, Bartosz had received a JBoss Community Award for his work on Arquillian and just last year he became the community manager for Arquillian.
            Today, Alex Soto, one of the faces on Bartosz' slide, is the lead of the Arquillian Cube project and co-author of Arquillian in Action and also a Devoxxian.
            Now Aslak, Bartosz & Alex form the core Arquillian team at Red Hat.
            What's good for the community members is good for the project.
            By passing on these opportunities, you invest in the project's future and build a devoted community.
            It starts with the project leadership and scales as the community grows.

            Recognition is something to be passed on.
            Each leader has recognition to share.
            Be a mirror.
            Reflect light on the people that deserve it.
            In doing so, you orchestrate the growth of the community.

            OSS is about you <em>not</em> doing it alone.
            Are you a ”wallflower” project?
            As the project matures, and if you want it to grow, you'll need to distribute the load.
            That means letting go of control; letting go of the wall.
            Otherwise, you'll be confined to only going where the edge can take you.
            I know that sounds scary.
            But if you don't move away from the wall, that's not really open source.
            And you won't benefit from it being open source.
            This is your chance to share opportunity with contributors and make them more autonomous.

            The more autonomous the community, the more the unique skills are magnified and compounded.
